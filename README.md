# Installation

## Config File

The VST Plugin requires a config file to successfully establish a TCP/IP connection to the SSR. The user has to create a file called <b>ssremote_config.xml</b> with the following content: 

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<config>
  <network>
    <host>localhost</host>
    <port>4711</port>
    <timeout>1000</timeout>
  </network>
</config>
```

| Markup | Description |
| ------:|:------------|
|network|the network configuration|
|host   |the host on which the SSR is running|
|port   |the port on which the SSR is listening for incoming TCP/IP requests|
|timeout|the time in milliseconds the VST Plugin waits for an answer by the SSR|

The contents of the markups host, port and timeout are just examples which the user may edit regarding his systems and SSR configuration.
