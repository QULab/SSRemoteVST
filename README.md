# SSRemote VST

This VST Plugin addresses the need for the automation of [SoundScapeRenderer (SSR)](http://spatialaudio.net/ssr/) scenes from a [Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation).

The SSRemote VST plugin was developed for Linux and tested with the [Ardour DAW](http://ardour.org/). Since the Plugin was developed in the light of cross-platform compatibility it might also run under other Operating Systems (OS) and DAWs.

Since this is a <b>experimental project</b>, any contributions are very much welcome!

# Installation

1. Clone the VST Plugin repository from Github:

  ```shell
  # HTTPS
  git clone https://github.com/QULab/SSRemoteVST.git

  # SSH
  git clone git@github.com:QULab/SSRemoteVST.git
  ```
2. Install the Steinberg VST SDK
  
  For installing the Steinberg VST SDK checkout the [Steinberg VST SDK Wiki Page](https://github.com/QULab/SSRemoteVST/wiki/Steinberg-VST).

3. Install the Boost Libs

  The SSRemote VST Plugin uses the Boost Libraries. In the most cases it might suffice to install the boost-devel package of your Linux distribution. For example:
  
  ```bash
  # DNF Package Manager
  sudo dnf install boost-devel
  
  # yum Package Manager
  sudo yum install boost-devel
  
  # apt-get Package Manager
  sudo apt-get install boost-devel
  ```
  
4. Install OpenGL
  
  The JUCE Framework uses OpenGL for the GUI. Please install the latest OpenGL Development package of your distribution. FOr Example

  ```bash
  # DNF Package Manager
  sudo dnf install freeglut-devel
  
  # yum Package Manager
  sudo yum install freeglut-devel
  
  # apt-get Package Manager
  sudo apt-get install freeglut-devel
  ```
5. Install the Jack Audio Connection Kit
  
  The SSRemote VST Plguin uses the Jack Audio Connection Kit. Please install the latest Jack Audio Connection Kit Development package of your distribution. For Example:

  ```bash
  # DNF Package Manager
  sudo dnf install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
  
  # yum Package Manager
  sudo yum install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
  
  # apt-get Package Manager
  sudo apt-get install jack-audio-connection-kit-devel
  ```
  
6. Install the ALSA Lib 

  The JUCE Framework uses the ALSA Libraries. Please install the latest ALSA Development package of your distribution. For Example: 

  ```bash
  # DNF Package Manager
  sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel
  
  # yum Package Manager
  sudo yum install alsa-lib-devel
  
  # apt-get Package Manager
  sudo apt-get install alsa-lib-devel
  ```
  
6. Install the freetype Lib 

  The JUCE Framework uses the freetype Libraries. Please install the latest freetype Development package of your distribution. For Example: 

  ```bash
  # DNF Package Manager
  sudo dnf install freetype-devel
  
  # yum Package Manager
  sudo yum install freetype-devel

  sudo apt-get install freetype-devel
  ```

* Set the environment variables

  Please set the following environment variables described as follows:

  The directory/location of the Steinberg VST3 SDK:
  
  ```bash
  # Steinberg VST3 Audio Plug-Ins SDK
  export VST3_SDK=/path/to/VST3SDK
  ```

  The directory/location of the SSRemote VST:

  ```bash
  # SSRemote VST
  export SSREMOTE_VST=/path/to/ssremote_vst
  ```

  The directory/location of the JUCE Framework located in the SSRemote VST::
  
  ```bash
  # SSRemote VST JUCE Framework
  export JUCE_LIB_CODE=$SSREMOTE_VST/JUCE
  ```

## Config File

The VST Plugin requires a config file to successfully establish a TCP/IP connection to the SSR. The user has to create a file called <b>ssremote_config.xml</b> with the following content: 

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<config>
  <network>
    <host>localhost</host>
    <port>4711</port>
    <timeout>1000</timeout>
  </network>
</config>
```

| Markup | Description |
| ------:|:------------|
|network|the network configuration|
|host   |the host on which the SSR is running|
|port   |the port on which the SSR is listening for incoming TCP/IP requests|
|timeout|the time in milliseconds the VST Plugin waits for an answer by the SSR|

The contents of the markups host, port and timeout are just examples which the user may edit regarding his systems and SSR configuration.



## Dependencies

The Plugin uses the [C++11 Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11) which has to be supported by your compiler (e.g. at least GCC 4.7).

The following libraries are used:

+ Steinberg VST
+ JUCE (currently located in the repository)
+ Boost C++ Library
+ Jack-Audio-Connection-Kit

## Running the VST Plugin

To remotly control the SSR scene from the Plugin the user has to do the following:

1. Start the JACK Audio Connection Kit
2. Start the SSR and load a scene
3. Start the DAW and load the SSRemote VST Plugin

## Description of the GUI

The VST Plugins GUI is generally splitted in two sections. The <b>General Controls</b> section and the <b>Source Controls</b> section. 

### General Controls

|Name       |GUI Element|Description|
|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
